## Usage
### ES Modules in Node
We use ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like


### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
### Run

```bash
node index.js
```
